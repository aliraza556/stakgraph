DECOMPOSE QUESTION into business context and specific implementation questions

  return `
You are bridging business requirements to technical implementation. Given a user request:

**User Request:** ${user_query}

## Step 1: Business Context Analysis
Identify the core business functionality and user workflows involved.

## Step 2: Implementation Questions
Generate 1-5 specific questions that developers would need to answer. Make each question:
- **Short and concise**
- **Specific enough** to match existing cached answers
- **Business-focused** but technically actionable  
- **Workflow-oriented** (following user journeys)
- **Entity-specific** (mention likely code components)

**Question Types to Consider:**
- **User Workflows**: "How does a user [specific action] in this system?"
- **Data Handling**: "How is [business entity] data stored/validated/retrieved?"
- **Business Logic**: "What happens when [business event] occurs?"
- **Integration Points**: "How does [business process] connect with [other system/feature]?"
- **Permissions**: "What user roles can [perform action] and how is this enforced?"
- **UI Patterns**: "What UI components handle [user interaction type]?"

**Format each question for optimal embedding:**
- Use business terminology first, technical second
- Include context: "In the context of [workflow], how does..."
- Be specific: Instead of "How to implement auth" â†’ "How does user password reset workflow work with email verification?"

**IMPORTANT:**
MAKE YOUR QUESTIONS SHORT AND CONCISE. DO NOT ASSUME THINGS ABOUT THE CODEBASE THAT YOU DON'T KNOW.

**EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT:**
{
  "business_context": "Brief description of core functionality",
  "questions": [
    "How does user registration workflow handle email verification and account activation?",
    "What user permission system controls access to workspace creation features?",
    ...
  ]
